# Mathematical Induction

## 6.1.  Proof by Mathematical Induction

Section 6.1 of *HTPI* introduces a new proof technique called *mathematical induction*.  It is used for proving statements of the form `∀ (n : Nat), P n`.  Here is how it works:

#### To prove a goal of the form `∀ (n : Nat), P n`:

::: {.ind}
First prove `P 0`, and then prove `∀ (n : Nat), P n → P (n + 1)`.  The first of these proofs is sometimes called the *base case* and the second the *induction step*.
:::

For an explanation of why this strategy works to establish the truth of `∀ (n : Nat), P n`, see *HTPI*.  Here we focus on using mathematical induction in Lean.

To use mathematical induction in a Lean proof, we will use the tactic `by_induc`.  If the goal has the form `∀ (n : Nat), P n`, then the `by_induc` tactic leaves the list of givens unchanged, but it replaces the goal with the goals for the base case and induction step.  Thus, the effect of the tactic can be summarized as follows:

::: {.lftrt}
::: {.bef}
```state
>> ⋮
⊢ ∀ (n : ℕ), P n
```
:::

::: {.aft}
```state
case Base_Case
>> ⋮
⊢ P 0
case Induction_Step
>> ⋮
⊢ ∀ (n : ℕ), P n → P (n + 1)
```

To illustrate proof by mathematical induction in Lean, we turn first to Example 6.1.2 in *HTPI*, which gives a proof of the statement $\forall n \in \mathbb{N} (3 \mid (n^3 - n))$.  For reasons that we will explain a little later, we will prove a slightly different theorem:  $\forall n \in \mathbb{N} (3 \mid (n^3 + 2n))$.  Here is a proof of the theorem, modeled on the proof in Example 6.1.2 of *HTPI*.

::: {.thm}
For every natural number $n$, $3 \mid (n^3 + 2n)$.
:::

::: {.proof}
We use mathematical induction.

Base Case:  If $n = 0$, then $n^3 + 2n = 0 = 3 \cdot 0$, so $3 \mid (n^3 + 2n)$.

Induction Step:  Let $n$ be an arbitrary natural number and suppose $3 \mid (n^3 + 2n)$.  Then we can choose an integer $k$ such that $3k = n^3 + 2n$.  Thus,
\begin{align*}
(n+1)^3 + 2(n+1) &= n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 + 2n + 2\\
&= (n^3 + 2n) + 3n^2 + 3n + 3\\
&= 3k + 3n^2 + 3n + 3\\
&= 3(k + n^2 + n + 1).
\end{align*}
Therefore $3 \mid ((n+1)^3 + 2(n+1))$, as required. [&nbsp;□]{.excl}\qedhere
:::

Now let's try writing the same proof in Lean.  We start, of course, with the `by_induc` tactic.

::: {.inout}
::: {.inpt}
```lean
theorem Like_Example_6_1_2 :
    ∀ (n : Nat), 3 ∣ n ^ 3 + 2 * n := by
  by_induc
  **done::
```
:::

::: {.outpt}
```state
case Base_Case
⊢ 3 ∣ 0 ^ 3 + 2 * 0
case Induction_Step
⊢ ∀ (n : ℕ),
>>  3 ∣ n ^ 3 + 2 * n →
>>  3 ∣ (n + 1) ^ 3 +
>>      2 * (n + 1)
```
:::
:::

The base case is easy:  The `define` tactic tells us that the goal means `∃ (c : Nat), 0 ^ 3 + 2 * 0 = 3 * c`, and then `apply Exists.intro 0` changes the goal to `0 ^ 3 + 2 * 0 = 3 * 0`.  Both sides are definitionally equal to `0`, so `rfl` finishes off the base case.  For the induction step, we begin, as in the *HTPI* proof, by introducing an arbitrary natural number `n` and assuming `3 ∣ n ^ 3 + 2 * n`.  This assumption is called the *inductive hypothesis*, so in the Lean proof we give it the identifier `ih`.  Our goal now is to prove `3 ∣ (n + 1) ^ 3 + 2 * (n + 1)`.

::: {.inout}
::: {.inpt}
```lean
theorem Like_Example_6_1_2 :
    ∀ (n : Nat), 3 ∣ n ^ 3 + 2 * n := by
  by_induc
  · -- Base Case

    apply Exists.intro 0
    rfl
    done
  · -- Induction Step
    fix n : Nat
    assume ih : 3 ∣ n ^ 3 + 2 * n
    **done::
  done
```
:::

::: {.outpt}
```state
case Induction_Step
n : ℕ
ih : 3 ∣ n ^ 3 + 2 * n
⊢ 3 ∣ (n + 1) ^ 3 +
>>      2 * (n + 1)
```
:::
:::

The rest of the Lean proof follows the model of the *HTPI* proof:  we use the inductive hypothesis to introduce a `k` such that `n ^ 3 + 2 * n = 3 * k`, and then we use a calculational proof to show that `(n + 1) ^ 3 + 2 * (n + 1) = 3 * (k + n ^ 2 + n + 1)`.

```lean

    ∀ (n : Nat), 3 ∣ n ^ 3 + 2 * n := by
  by_induc
  · -- Base Case
    define         --Goal: ∃ (c : ℕ), 0 ^ 3 + 2 * 0 = 3 * c
    apply Exists.intro 0

  · -- Induction Step
    fix n : Nat
    assume ih : 3 ∣ n ^ 3 + 2 * n
    define at ih   --ih: ∃ (c : ℕ), n ^ 3 + 2 * n = 3 * c
    obtain (k : Nat) (h1 : n ^ 3 + 2 * n = 3 * k) from ih
    define         --Goal: ∃ (c : ℕ), (n + 1) ^ 3 + 2 * (n + 1) = 3 * c
    apply Exists.intro (k + n ^ 2 + n + 1)
    show (n + 1) ^ 3 + 2 * (n + 1) = 3 * (k + n ^ 2 + n + 1) from
      calc (n + 1) ^ 3 + 2 * (n + 1)
          = n ^ 3 + 2 * n + 3 * n ^ 2 + 3 * n + 3 := by ring
        _ = 3 * k + 3 * n ^ 2 + 3 * n + 3 := by rw [h1]
        _ = 3 * (k + n ^ 2 + n + 1) := by ring
    done
  done
```

Next we'll look at Example 6.1.1 in *HTPI*, which proves that for every natural number $n$, $2^0 + 2^1 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1$.  Once again, we will change the theorem slightly before proving it in Lean.  What we will prove is that for every $n$, $(2^0 + 2^1 + \cdots + 2^n) + 1 = 2^{n+1}$.  To understand this theorem you must be able to recognize what the "$\cdots$" stands for.  A human reader will probably realize that the numbers being added up here are the numbers of the form $2^i$, where $i$ runs through all of the natural numbers from 0 to $n$.  But Lean can't be expected to figure out this pattern, so we must be more explicit.

Section 6.3 of *HTPI* introduces the explicit notation that mathematicians usually use for such sums.  If $f$ is a function whose domain is the natural numbers, then
$$
\sum_{i=0}^n f(i) = f(0) + f(1) + \cdots + f(n).
$$
More generally, if $k \le n$ then
$$
\sum_{i=k}^n f(i) = f(k) + f(k+1) + \cdots + f(n).
$$

The notation we will use in Lean for this sum is `Sum i from k to n, f i`.  Thus, a mathematician would state our theorem like this:

::: {.thm}
For every natural number $n$,
$$
\left(\sum_{i=0}^n 2^i\right) + 1 = 2^{n+1}.
$$
:::

And to state the same theorem in Lean, we will write:

```lean
theorem Like_Example_6_1_1 :
    ∀ (n : Nat), (Sum i from 0 to n, 2 ^ i) + 1 = 2 ^ (n + 1)
```

We will have more to say later about how the notation `Sum i from k to n, f i` is defined.  But to use the notation in a proof, we will just need to know a couple of theorems.  The `#check` command will tell us the meanings of the theorems `sum_from_to_base` and `sum_from_to_step`:

::: {.ind}
```
@sum_from_to_base : ∀ {A : Type} [inst : AddZeroClass A]
                    {k : ℕ} {f : ℕ → A},
                    Sum i from k to k, f i = f k
@sum_from_to_step : ∀ {A : Type} [inst : AddZeroClass A]
                    {k n : ℕ} {f : ℕ → A},
                    k ≤ n → Sum i from k to n + 1, f i =
                    (Sum i from k to n, f i) + f (n + 1)
```
:::

As usual, we don't need to pay too much attention to the implicit arguments in the first two lines of each statement.  What is important is that `sum_from_to_base` can be used to prove any statement of the form

::: {.ind}
```
Sum i from k to k, f i = f k
```
:::

and `sum_from_to_step` proves any statement of the form

::: {.ind}
```
k ≤ n → Sum i from k to n + 1, f i = (Sum i from k to n, f i) + f (n + 1)
```
:::

With that preparation, we can start on the proof.  Once again we begin with the `by_induc` tactic.  Our goal for the base case is `(Sum i from 0 to 0, 2 ^ i) + 1 = 2 ^ (0 + 1)`.  To deal with the term `Sum i from 0 to 0, 2 ^ i`, we use that fact that `sum_from_to_base` proves `Sum i from 0 to 0, 2 ^ i = 2 ^ 0`.  It follows that the tactic `rewrite [sum_from_to_base]` will change the goal to `2 ^ 0 + 1 = 2 ^ (0 + 1)`.  Of course, this means `2 = 2`, so `rfl` finishes the base case.  For the induction step, we start by introducing an arbitrary natural number `n` and assuming the inductive hypothesis.

```lean
theorem Like_Example_6_1_1 :
    ∀ (n : Nat), (Sum i from 0 to n, 2 ^ i) + 1 = 2 ^ (n + 1) := by
  by_induc
  · -- Base Case
    rewrite [sum_from_to_base]
    rfl
    done
  · -- Induction Step
    fix n : Nat
    assume ih : (Sum i from 0 to n, 2 ^ i) + 1 = 2 ^ (n + 1)
    **done::
  done
```

Our goal is now `(Sum i from 0 to n + 1, 2 ^ i) + 1 = 2 ^ (n + 1 + 1)`, and we use a calculational proof to prove this.  Often the key to the proof of the induction step is to find a relationship between the inductive hypothesis and the goal.  In this case, that means finding a relationship between `Sum i from 0 to n, 2 ^ i` and `Sum i from 0 to n + 1, 2 ^ i`.  The relationship we need is given by the theorem `sum_from_to_step`.  The tactic `rewrite [sum_from_to_step _]` will replace `Sum i from 0 to n + 1, 2 ^ i` with `(Sum i from 0 to n, 2 ^ i) + 2 ^ (n + 1)`, if we can fill in the blank with a proof of `0 ≤ n`.  Fortunately, this is easy to prove: you can use the `#check` command to confirm that `Nat.zero_le` is the theorem `∀ (n : Nat), 0 ≤ n`, so `Nat.zero_le n` is the proof we need.  The rest of the calculation proof involves straightforward algebra, handled by the `ring` tactic, together with an application of the inductive hypothesis.

```lean
theorem Like_Example_6_1_1 :
    ∀ (n : Nat), (Sum i from 0 to n, 2 ^ i) + 1 = 2 ^ (n + 1) := by
  by_induc

    rewrite [sum_from_to_base]
    rfl
    done
  · -- Induction Step
    fix n : Nat
    assume ih : (Sum i from 0 to n, 2 ^ i) + 1 = 2 ^ (n + 1)
    show (Sum i from 0 to n + 1, 2 ^ i) + 1 = 2 ^ (n + 1 + 1) from
      calc (Sum i from 0 to n + 1, 2 ^ i) + 1
          = (Sum i from 0 to n, 2 ^ i) + 2 ^ (n + 1) + 1 :=
            by rw [sum_from_to_step (Nat.zero_le n)]
        _ = (Sum i from 0 to n, 2 ^ i) + 1 + 2 ^ (n + 1) := by ring
        _ = 2 ^ (n + 1) + 2 ^ (n + 1) := by rw [ih]
        _ = 2 ^ (n + 1 + 1) := by ring
    done
  done
```

The last example in Section 6.1 of *HTPI* gives a proof of the statement $\forall n \ge 5 (2^n > n^2)$.  The proof is by mathematical induction, but since we are only interested in natural numbers greater than or equal to 5, it uses 5 in the base case instead of 0.  Here are the theorem and proof from *HTPI*:

::: {.thm}
For every natural number $n \ge 5$, $2^n > n^2$.
:::

::: {.proof}
By mathematical induction.

Base case:  When $n = 5$ we have $2^n = 32 > 25 = n^2$.

Induction step:  Let $n \ge 5$ be arbitrary, and suppose that $2^n > n^2$.  Then
\begin{align*}
2^{n+1} &= 2 \cdot 2^n\\
&> 2n^2 &&\text{(inductive hypothesis)}\\
&= n^2 + n^2\\
&\ge n^2 + 5n &&\text{(since $n \ge 5$)}\\
&= n^2 + 2n + 3n\\
&> n^2 + 2n + 1 = (n+1)^2. &&\Box
\end{align*}
\renewcommand{\qed}{}
:::

Notice that the sequence of calculations at the end of the proof mixes $=$, $>$, and $\ge$ in a way that establishes the final conclusion $2^{n+1} > (n+1)^2$.  As we'll see, such a mixture is allowed in calculational proofs in Lean as well.

To write this proof in Lean, there is no need to specify that the base case should be `n = 5`; the `by_induc` tactic is smart enough to figure that out on its own, as you can see in the tactic state below:

::: {.inout}
::: {.inpt}
```lean
theorem Example_6_1_3 :
    ∀ n ≥ 5, 2 ^ n > n ^ 2 := by
  by_induc
  **done::
```
:::

::: {.outpt}
```state
case Base_Case
⊢ 2 ^ 5 > 5 ^ 2
case Induction_Step
⊢ ∀ (n : ℕ), n ≥ 5 →
>>  2 ^ n > n ^ 2 →
>>  2 ^ (n + 1) >
>>      (n + 1) ^ 2
```
:::
:::

To complete this proof we'll use two tactics we haven't used before: `norm_num` and `linarith`.  The base case can be proven by simply doing the arithmetic necessary to check that the inequality holds when `n = 5`.  The tactic `norm_num` does such numerical calculations, and it proves the base case.

For the induction step, we introduce an arbitrary natural number `n`, assume `n ≥ 5`, and assume the inductive hypothesis, `2 ^ n > n ^ 2`.  Then we use a calculational proof to imitate the reasoning at the end of the *HTPI* proof.  The tactic `linarith` makes inferences that involve combining linear equations and inequalities.  It is able to prove almost all of the inequalities in the calculational proof.  The exception is `n * n ≥ 5 * n`, so we prove that inequality separately, using a theorem from Lean's library.  (You can use the `#check` command to see what that theorem says.)  Once we have proven that inequality, the `linarith` tactic can use it to complete the required inequality reasoning.

```lean
theorem Example_6_1_3 : ∀ n ≥ 5, 2 ^ n > n ^ 2 := by
  by_induc
  · -- Base Case
    norm_num
    done
  · -- Induction Step

    assume h1 : n ≥ 5
    assume ih : 2 ^ n > n ^ 2
    have h2 : n * n ≥ 5 * n := Nat.mul_le_mul_right n h1
    show 2 ^ (n + 1) > (n + 1) ^ 2 from
      calc 2 ^ (n + 1)
          = 2 * 2 ^ n := by ring
        _ > n ^ 2 + 2 * n + 1 := by linarith
        _ = (n + 1) ^ 2 := by ring
    done
  done
```

Finally, we turn to the question of why we made small changes in two of the examples from *HTPI*.  Perhaps you have guessed by now that we were trying to avoid the use of subtraction.  All of the numbers in the examples in this section were natural numbers, and subtraction of natural numbers is problematic.  In the natural numbers, `3 - 2` is equal to `1`, but what is `2 - 3`?  Lean's answer is `0`.

```lean
++#eval:: 2 - 3     --Answer: 0
```

In Lean, if `a` and `b` are natural numbers and `a < b`, then `a - b` is defined to be `0`.  As a result, the algebraic laws of natural number subtraction are complicated.  For example, `2 - 3 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`, but `2 + 1 - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0`, so it is not true that for all natural numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`, `a - b + c = a + c - b`.

If you thought that the answer to the subtraction problem `2 - 3` was `-1`, then you automatically switched from the natural numbers to the integers.  (Recall that the natural numbers are the numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., and the integers include negative integers as well.)  To a human mathematician, this is a perfectly natural thing to do: the natural numbers are a subset of the integers, so `2` and `3` are not only natural numbers but also integers, and we can compute `2 - 3` in the integers.

However, that's not how things work in Lean.  In Lean, different types are completely separate.  In particular, `Nat` and `Int` are separate types, and therefore the natural numbers are not a subset of the integers.  Of course, there is an integer 2, but it is different from the natural number 2.  By default, Lean assumes that `2` denotes the natural number 2, but you can specify that you want the integer 2 by writing `(2 : Int)`.  Subtraction of integers in Lean is the subtraction you are familiar with, and it has all the algebraic properties you would expect.  If we want to use subtraction in the theorems in this section, we are better off using familiar integer subtraction rather than funky natural number subtraction.

To prove the theorem in Example 6.1.1 as it appears in *HTPI*, we could state the theorem like this:

```lean
theorem Example_6_1_1 :
    ∀ (n : Nat), Sum i from 0 to n, (2 : Int) ^ i =
    (2 : Int) ^ (n + 1) - (1 : Int)
```

The expression `Sum i from 0 to n, (2 : Int) ^ i` denotes a sum of integers, so it is an integer.  Similarly, the right side of the equation is an integer, and the equation asserts the equality of two integers.  The subtraction on the right side of the equation is integer subtraction, so we can use the usual algebraic laws to reason about it.  In fact, the proof of the theorem in this form is not hard:

```lean
theorem Example_6_1_1 :
    ∀ (n : Nat), Sum i from 0 to n, (2 : Int) ^ i =
    (2 : Int) ^ (n + 1) - (1 : Int) := by
  by_induc
  · -- Base Case
    rewrite [sum_from_to_base]
    rfl
    done
  · -- Induction Step
    fix n : Nat
    assume ih : Sum i from 0 to n, (2 : Int) ^ i =
      (2 : Int) ^ (n + 1) - (1 : Int)
    rewrite [sum_from_to_step (Nat.zero_le n), ih]
      --Goal: 2 ^ (n + 1) - 1 + 2 ^ (n + 1) = 2 ^ (n + 1 + 1) - 1
    ring
    done
  done
```

If you change `(2 : Int)` and `(1 : Int)` to `2` and `1`, then the right side of the equation will be a difference of two natural numbers, and Lean will interpret the subtraction as natural number subtraction.  The proof won't work because the `ring` tactic is not able to deal with the peculiar algebraic properties of natural number subtraction.  (The theorem is still true, but the proof is harder.)

## 6.2. More Examples

We saw in the last section that mathematical induction can be used to prove theorems about calculations involving natural numbers.  But mathematical induction has a much wider range of uses.  Section 6.2 of *HTPI* illustrates this by proving two theorems about finite sets.

How can mathematical induction be used to prove a statement about finite sets?  To say that a set is finite means that it has $n$ elements, for some natural number $n$.  Thus, to say that all finite sets have some property, we can say that for every natural number $n$, every set with $n$ elements has the property.  Since this statement starts with "for every natural number $n$," we can use mathematical induction to try to prove it.

What does it mean to say that a set "has $n$ elements"?  Section 6.2 of *HTPI* says that for the proofs in that section, "an intuitive understanding of this concept will suffice."  Unfortunately, intuition is not Lean's strong suit!  So we'll need to be more explicit about how to talk about finite sets in Lean.

In Chapter 8, we'll define `numElts X n` to be a proposition saying that the set `X` has `n` elements, and we'll prove several theorems involving that proposition.  Those theorems make precise and explicit the intuitive ideas that we'll need in this section.  We'll state those theorems here and use them in our proofs, but you'll have to wait until Chapter 8 to see how they are proven.  Here are the theorems we'll need:

```lean
theorem zero_elts_iff_empty {A : Type} (X : Set A) :
    numElts X 0 ↔ empty X

theorem one_elt_iff_singleton {A : Type} (X : Set A) :
    numElts X 1 ↔ ∃ (x : A), X = {x}

theorem nonempty_of_pos_numElts {A : Type} {X : Set A} {n : Nat}
    (h1 : numElts X n) (h2 : n > 0) : ∃ (x : A), x ∈ X

theorem remove_one_numElts {A : Type} {X : Set A} {n : Nat} {x : A}
    (h1 : numElts X (n + 1)) (h2 : x ∈ X) : numElts (X \ {x}) n
```

These theorems should make intuitive sense.  The first says that a set has zero elements if and only if it is empty, and the second says that a set has one element if and only if it is a singleton set.  The third theorem says that if a set has a positive number of elements, then there is something in the set.  And the fourth says that if a set has $n + 1$ elements and you remove one element, then the resulting set has $n$ elements.  You can probably guess that we'll be using the last theorem in the induction steps of our proofs.

Our first theorem about finite sets says that if $R$ is a partial order on $A$, then every finite, nonempty subset of $A$ has an $R$-minimal element.  (This is not true in general for infinite subsets of $A$.  Can you think of an example of an infinite subset of a partially ordered set that has no minimal element?)  To say that a set is finite and nonempty we can say that it has $n$ elements for some $n \ge 1$.  So here's how we state our theorem in Lean:

```lean
theorem Example_6_2_1 {A : Type} (R : BinRel A) (h : partial_order R) :
    ∀ n ≥ 1, ∀ (B : Set A), numElts B n →
      ∃ (x : A), minimalElt R x B
```

When we use mathematical induction to prove this theorem, the base case will be `n = 1`.  To prove the base case, we start by assuming `B` is a set with one element.  We can then use the theorem `one_elt_iff_singleton` to conclude that `B = {b}`, for some `b` of type `A`.  We need to prove that `B` has a minimal element, and the only possibility for the minimal element is `b`.  Verifying that `minimalElt R b B` is straightforward.  Here is the proof of the base case:

```lean
theorem Example_6_2_1 {A : Type} (R : BinRel A) (h : partial_order R) :
    ∀ n ≥ 1, ∀ (B : Set A), numElts B n →

Notice that since the definition of `minimalElt R b B` involves a negative statement, we found it convenient to use proof by contradiction to prove it.

For the induction step, we assume that `n ≥ 1` and that every set with `n` elements has an `R`-minimal element.  We must prove that every set with `n + 1` elements has a minimal element, so we let `B` be an arbitrary set with `n + 1` elements.  To apply the inductive hypothesis, we need a set with `n` elements.  So we pick some `b ∈ B` (using the theorem `nonempty_of_pos_numElts`) and then remove it from `B` to get the set `B' = B \ {b}`.  The theorem `remove_one_numElts` tells us that `B'` has `n` elements, so by the inductive hypothesis, we can then let `c` be a minimal element of `B'`.  We now know about two elements of `B`:  `b` and `c`.  Which will be a minimal element of `B`?  As explained in *HTPI*, it depends on whether or not `R b c`.  We'll prove that if `R b c`, then `b` is a minimal element of `B`, and if not, then `c` is a minimal element.  It will be convenient to prove these last two facts separately as lemmas.  The first lemma says that in the situation at this point in the proof, if `R b c`, then `b` is an `R`-minimal element of `B`.  Here is the proof.

```lean
lemma Lemma_6_2_1_1 {A : Type} {R : BinRel A} {B : Set A} {b c : A}
    (h1 : partial_order R) (h2 : b ∈ B) (h3 : minimalElt R c (B \ {b}))
    (h4 : R b c) : minimalElt R b B := by

    --h3: c ∈ B \ {b} ∧ ¬∃ (x : A), x ∈ B \ {b} ∧ R x c ∧ x ≠ c
  define  --Goal: b ∈ B ∧ ¬∃ (x : A), x ∈ B ∧ R x b ∧ x ≠ b
  apply And.intro h2  --Goal: ¬∃ (x : A), x ∈ B ∧ R x b ∧ x ≠ b

  obtain (x : A) (h6 : x ∈ B ∧ R x b ∧ x ≠ b) from h5
  apply Exists.intro x
  apply And.intro

    show x ∈ B \ {b} from And.intro h6.left h6.right.right
    done
  · -- Proof that R x c ∧ x ≠ c
    have Rtrans : transitive R := h1.right.left
    have h7 : R x c := Rtrans x b c h6.right.left h4
    apply And.intro h7
    by_contra h8
    rewrite [h8] at h6
    have Rantisymm : antisymmetric R := h1.right.right
    have h9 : c = b := Rantisymm c b h6.right.left h4
    show False from h6.right.right h9
    done
  done
```

The second lemma says that if `¬R b c`, then `c` is an `R`-minimal element of `B`.  We'll leave the proof as an exercise for you:

```lean
lemma Lemma_6_2_1_2 {A : Type} {R : BinRel A} {B : Set A} {b c : A}
    (h1 : partial_order R) (h2 : b ∈ B) (h3 : minimalElt R c (B \ {b}))
    (h4 : ¬R b c) : minimalElt R c B := sorry
```

With this preparation, we are finally ready to give the proof of the induction step of `Example_6_2_1`:

```lean

    obtain (b : A) (h5 : b ∈ B) from nonempty_of_pos_numElts h3 h4
    let B' : Set A := B \ {b}
    have h6 : numElts B' n := remove_one_numElts h3 h5
    obtain (c : A) (h7 : minimalElt R c B') from ih B' h6

We'll consider one more theorem from Section 6.2 of *HTPI*.  Example 6.2.2 proves that a partial order on a finite set can always be extended to a total order.  Rather than give that proof, we are going to prove the more general theorem that is stated in Exercise 2 in Section 6.2 of *HTPI*.  To explain the theorem in that exercise, it will be helpful to introduce a bit of terminology.  Suppose `R` is a partial order on `A` and `b` has type `A`.  We will say that `b` is *`R`-comparable to everything* if `∀ (x : A), R b x ∨ R x b`.  If `B` is a set of objects of type `A`, we say that `B` is *`R`-comparable to everything* if every element of `B` is `R`-comparable to everything; that is, if `∀ b ∈ B, ∀ (x : A), R b x ∨ R x b`.  Finally, we say that another binary relation `T` *extends* `R` if `∀ (x y : A), R x y → T x y`.  We are going to prove that if `R` is a partial order on `A` and `B` is a finite set of objects of type `A`, then there is a partial order `T` that extends `R` such that `B` is `T`-comparable to everything.  In other words, we are going to prove the following theorem:

```lean
theorem Exercise_6_2_2 {A : Type} (R : BinRel A) (h : partial_order R) :
    ∀ (n : Nat) (B : Set A), numElts B n → ∃ (T : BinRel A),
    partial_order T ∧ (∀ (x y : A), R x y → T x y) ∧
    ∀ x ∈ B, ∀ (y : A), T x y ∨ T y x
```

In the exercises, we will ask you to show that this implies the theorem in Example 6.2.2.

It will be helpful to begin with a warm-up exercise.  We'll show that a partial order can always be extended to make a single object comparable to everthing.  In other words, we'll show that if `R` is a partial order on `A` and `b` has type `A`, then we can define a partial order `T` extending `R` such that `b` is `T`-comparable to everything.  To define `T`, we will need to make sure that for every `x` of type `A`, either `T b x` or `T x b`.  If `R x b`, then since `T` must extend `R`, we must have `T x b`.  If `¬R x b`, then we will define `T` so that `T b x`.  But notice that if we follow this plan, then for any `x` and `y`, if we have `R x b` and `¬R y b`, then we will have `T x b` and `T b y`, and since `T` must be transitive, we must then have `T x y`.  Summing up, if we have `R x y` then we must have `T x y`, and if we have `R x b` and `¬R y b` then we will also need to have `T x y`.  So let's try defining `T x y` to mean `R x y ∨ (R x b ∧ ¬R y b)`.

It will be useful to have a name for this relation `T`.  Since it is an extension of `R` determined by the element `b`, we will give it the name `extendPO R b`.  Here is the definition of this relation:

```lean
def extendPO {A : Type} (R : BinRel A) (b : A) (x y : A) : Prop :=
    R x y ∨ (R x b ∧ ¬R y b)
```

We need to prove a number of things about `extendPO R b`.  First of all, we need to prove that it is a partial order.  We'll leave most of the details as exercises for you:

```lean
lemma extendPO_is_ref {A : Type} (R : BinRel A) (b : A)
    (h : partial_order R) : reflexive (extendPO R b) := sorry

lemma extendPO_is_trans {A : Type} (R : BinRel A) (b : A)
    (h : partial_order R) : transitive (extendPO R b) := sorry

lemma extendPO_is_antisymm {A : Type} (R : BinRel A) (b : A)
    (h : partial_order R) : antisymmetric (extendPO R b) := sorry

lemma extendPO_is_po {A : Type} (R : BinRel A) (b : A)
    (h : partial_order R) : partial_order (extendPO R b) := 
  And.intro (extendPO_is_ref R b h)
    (And.intro (extendPO_is_trans R b h) (extendPO_is_antisymm R b h))
```

It is easy to prove that `extendPO R b` extends `R`:

```lean
lemma extendPO_extends {A : Type} (R : BinRel A) (b : A) (x y : A) :
    R x y → extendPO R b x y := by
  assume h1 : R x y
  define
  show R x y ∨ R x b ∧ ¬R y b from Or.inl h1
  done
```

Finally, we verify that `extendPO R b` does what it was supposed to do: it makes `b` comparable with everything:

```lean
lemma extendPO_all_comp {A : Type} (R : BinRel A) (b : A)
    (h : partial_order R) :
    ∀ (x : A), extendPO R b b x ∨ extendPO R b x b := by
  have Rref : reflexive R := h.left
  fix x : A
  or_left with h1
  define at h1     --h1: ¬(R x b ∨ R x b ∧ ¬R b b)
  demorgan at h1   --h1: ¬R x b ∧ ¬(R x b ∧ ¬R b b)
  define           --Goal: R b x ∨ R b b ∧ ¬R x b
  apply Or.inr
  show R b b ∧ ¬R x b from And.intro (Rref b) h1.left
  done
```

With this preparation, we can finally return to our theorem `Exercise_6_2_2`.  We will prove it by mathematical induction.  In the base case we must show that if `B` has 0 elements then we can extend `R` to make everything in `B` comparable to everything.  Of course, no extension is necessary, since it is vacuously true that all elements of `B` are `R`-comparable to everything.  For the induction step, after assuming the inductive hypothesis, we must prove that if `B` has `n + 1` elements then we can extend `R` to make all elements of `B` comparable to everything.  As before, we choose `b ∈ B` and let `B' = B \ {b}`.  By inductive hypothesis, we can find an extension `T'` of `R` that makes all elements of `B'` comparable to everything, so we just have to extend `T'` further to make `b` comparable to everything.  But as we have just seen, we can do this with `extendPO T' b`.
